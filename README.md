<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A cryptocurrency website where you can find the latest information (Market cap, price change, etc) on the top 100 global cryptocurrencies. You can view this information and favorite as as a registered user! Registered Users can keep track and remove their favorited cryptocurrencies.

The different functionalities of Cryptoinfoweb:

- View latest price information from Coingecko API about global cryptocurrencies.
- Create an account and favorite your preferred cryptocurrencies.
- Learn about blockchain and cryptocurrencies
- Usage of Material UI Components such as Topbar, Hero, Table, Footer, Grid, Box, et
- Use of reusable components such as some of the Chart Components

These were some of the facets I wanted to incorporate into this app as they would mimic some of the major features of popular cyprocurrency apps like Coinbase. 

This was a fun project and there are a lot of features I would like to add in the future!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Architecture

- I used a MVC architecture in conjunction with a React-Redux store on the frontend. I have a views folder that acts as the views, a state folder that acts as the model, and the Controllers are specific components. I also have utilised a MVC architecture for the backend. I've included diagrams below:
